# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Retail Sales** domain. The estimated data quality score is **71/100**, which indicates a **moderate** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **Profit**, and the inferred task type is **Regression**. Confidence in this target selection is **High**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **16302 rows** and **26 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Total Sales** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Profit Margin** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Order Value** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **Quantity**: estimated importance **0.42**
- **Discount**: estimated importance **0.38**
- **Region**: estimated importance **0.26**

## Visualization Insights
- **Profit by Category** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Monthly Sales Trend** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Requires Preprocessing** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** False  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** XGBoost Regressor  

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
2. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
3. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **retail_sales_133.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
