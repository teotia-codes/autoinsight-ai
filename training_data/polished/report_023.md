# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Financial Credit** domain. The estimated data quality score is **53/100**, which indicates a **low** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **Default**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **Medium**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **12709 rows** and **9 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields  
- **Moderate Issues:** High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Delinquency Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Default Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Credit Utilization** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **LatePayments**: estimated importance **0.45**
- **Income**: estimated importance **0.36**
- **DebtToIncome**: estimated importance **0.34**

## Visualization Insights
- **Utilization Distribution** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Income vs Default** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Conditionally Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** Potential target leakage in engineered columns  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier  

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **credit_risk_023.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
