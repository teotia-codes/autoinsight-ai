# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Customer Churn** domain. The estimated data quality score is **92/100**, which indicates a **high** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **RetentionRisk**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **Moderate**, with ambiguity status set to **True**. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **16279 rows** and **24 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Minor missing values in non-critical columns  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Average Revenue per User** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Churn Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Retention Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **SupportCalls**: estimated importance **0.34**
- **Tenure**: estimated importance **0.28**
- **Usage**: estimated importance **0.25**

## Visualization Insights
- **Tenure Distribution** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Revenue by Segment** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** False  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** No immediate leakage indicators detected  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** CatBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier  

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **customer_churn_217.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
