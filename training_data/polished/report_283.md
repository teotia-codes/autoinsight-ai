# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Retail Sales** domain. The estimated data quality score is **53/100**, which indicates a **low** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **Order Value**, and the inferred task type is **Regression**. Confidence in this target selection is **High**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **36349 rows** and **18 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields  
- **Moderate Issues:** High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Profit Margin** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Order Value** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Total Sales** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **Region**: estimated importance **0.41**
- **Shipping Cost**: estimated importance **0.37**
- **Discount**: estimated importance **0.27**

## Visualization Insights
- **Profit by Category** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Regional Sales Distribution** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** False  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** No immediate leakage indicators detected  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM Regressor  

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
2. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
3. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **retail_sales_283.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
