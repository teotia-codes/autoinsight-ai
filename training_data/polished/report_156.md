# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Healthcare Risk** domain. The estimated data quality score is **56/100**, which indicates a **low** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **DiabetesRisk**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **Moderate**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **7025 rows** and **35 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields  
- **Moderate Issues:** High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Risk Prevalence** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Positive Class Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Biomarker Score** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **BMI**: estimated importance **0.42**
- **BloodPressure**: estimated importance **0.26**
- **Insulin**: estimated importance **0.2**

## Visualization Insights
- **Age vs Risk** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Biomarker Correlation Heatmap** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** False  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** No immediate leakage indicators detected  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression  

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **healthcare_risk_156.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
