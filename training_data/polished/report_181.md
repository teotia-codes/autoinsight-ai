# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Healthcare Risk** domain. The estimated data quality score is **94/100**, which indicates a **high** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **HeartDiseaseRisk**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **Moderate**, with ambiguity status set to **True**. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **40482 rows** and **11 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Minor missing values in non-critical columns  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Risk Prevalence** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Biomarker Score** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Positive Class Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **Age**: estimated importance **0.36**
- **BloodPressure**: estimated importance **0.3**
- **Insulin**: estimated importance **0.25**

## Visualization Insights
- **Age vs Risk** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Biomarker Correlation Heatmap** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Requires Preprocessing** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** False  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression  

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **healthcare_risk_181.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
