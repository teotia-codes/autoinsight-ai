# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Financial Credit** domain. The estimated data quality score is **87/100**, which indicates a **high** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **Default**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **High**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **26252 rows** and **16 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Minor missing values in non-critical columns  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Average Credit Utilization** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Delinquency Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Default Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **LoanAmount**: estimated importance **0.48**
- **Income**: estimated importance **0.34**
- **DebtToIncome**: estimated importance **0.19**

## Visualization Insights
- **Utilization Distribution** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Income vs Default** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Conditionally Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** Potential target leakage in engineered columns  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** XGBoost Classifier, LightGBM Classifier  

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **credit_risk_132.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
