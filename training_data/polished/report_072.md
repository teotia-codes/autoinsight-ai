# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Financial Credit** domain. The estimated data quality score is **80/100**, which indicates a **moderate** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **Default**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **Medium**, with ambiguity status set to **True**. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **42896 rows** and **10 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Delinquency Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Credit Utilization** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Default Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **LoanAmount**: estimated importance **0.45**
- **Income**: estimated importance **0.3**
- **DebtToIncome**: estimated importance **0.2**

## Visualization Insights
- **Income vs Default** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Default Rate by Segment** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Conditionally Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** Potential target leakage in engineered columns  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier  

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **credit_risk_072.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
