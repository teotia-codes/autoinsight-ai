# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Supply Chain** domain. The estimated data quality score is **73/100**, which indicates a **moderate** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **StockoutRisk**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **High**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **25597 rows** and **17 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Average Fulfillment Time** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Stockout Frequency** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **On-Time Delivery Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **OrderVolume**: estimated importance **0.27**
- **LeadTime**: estimated importance **0.23**
- **InventoryLevel**: estimated importance **0.22**

## Visualization Insights
- **Lead Time Trend** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Stockout by Warehouse** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** False  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** No immediate leakage indicators detected  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** XGBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor  

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
2. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
3. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **supply_chain_135.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
