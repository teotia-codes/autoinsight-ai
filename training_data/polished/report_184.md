# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Supply Chain** domain. The estimated data quality score is **63/100**, which indicates a **low** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **StockoutRisk**, and the inferred task type is **Classification**. Confidence in this target selection is **Medium**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **14854 rows** and **24 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields  
- **Moderate Issues:** High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Stockout Frequency** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **On-Time Delivery Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Fulfillment Time** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **SupplierRegion**: estimated importance **0.4**
- **TransportMode**: estimated importance **0.39**
- **OrderVolume**: estimated importance **0.28**

## Visualization Insights
- **Stockout by Warehouse** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Lead Time Trend** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Requires Preprocessing** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** False  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** XGBoost Regressor  

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **supply_chain_184.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
