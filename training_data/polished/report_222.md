# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Retail Sales** domain. The estimated data quality score is **77/100**, which indicates a **moderate** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **Order Value**, and the inferred task type is **Regression**. Confidence in this target selection is **Moderate**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **34624 rows** and **32 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Average Order Value** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Gross Profit** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Profit Margin** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **Category**: estimated importance **0.44**
- **Discount**: estimated importance **0.32**
- **Shipping Cost**: estimated importance **0.21**

## Visualization Insights
- **Regional Sales Distribution** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Monthly Sales Trend** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Conditionally Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** True  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** Potential target leakage in engineered columns  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** LightGBM Regressor, Random Forest Regressor  

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **retail_sales_222.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
