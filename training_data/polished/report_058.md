# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset is suitable for exploratory and predictive analysis in the **Supply Chain** domain. The estimated data quality score is **89/100**, which indicates a **high** readiness level for downstream analytics. With targeted preprocessing, target validation, and baseline benchmarking, the dataset can support KPI monitoring, signal ranking, and early-stage machine learning workflows.

## Target Validation
The most likely target variable is **DeliveryDelay**, and the inferred task type is **Regression**. Confidence in this target selection is **Medium**, with ambiguity status set to **False**. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
The dataset contains approximately **21871 rows** and **27 columns**.  
- **Critical Issues:** No critical issues were explicitly detected  
- **Moderate Issues:** Minor missing values in non-critical columns  
- **Recommended Remediation:** Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training  

This indicates that the dataset is analytically useful, but some preprocessing steps should be completed before production-grade modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability. These findings should be interpreted as directional analytical evidence rather than proof of causality.

## KPI Highlights
- **Stockout Frequency** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **Average Fulfillment Time** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.
- **On-Time Delivery Rate** should be monitored across time, segments, and operational slices to surface actionable performance patterns.

## Signal Ranking Highlights
The preliminary signal ranking suggests the following variables are the strongest contributors:
- **SupplierRegion**: estimated importance **0.44**
- **LeadTime**: estimated importance **0.44**
- **TransportMode**: estimated importance **0.36**

## Visualization Insights
- **Delay by Supplier** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.
- **Lead Time Trend** can support trend detection, anomaly review, and stakeholder interpretation.

## ML Readiness Assessment
The dataset is currently assessed as **Ready** for machine learning.  
- **ML Ready:** True  
- **Class Imbalance Flag:** False  
- **Potential Leakage Risk:** No immediate leakage indicators detected  
- **Recommended Preprocessing:** Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding  
- **Suggested Baseline Models:** Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor  

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set. These issues should be addressed before treating model performance as production-ready.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
3. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.

## Conclusion
This report provides a structured assessment of **supply_chain_058.csv** and indicates that the dataset has meaningful analytical value. With proper target validation, data cleaning, leakage review, and baseline model benchmarking, it can support both business intelligence workflows and early-stage predictive modeling.
