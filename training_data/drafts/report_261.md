# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to healthcare risk and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is HeartDiseaseRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 75/100 with about 10562 rows and 26 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Risk Prevalence: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Biomarker Score: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Positive Class Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- BMI: 0.4
- BloodPressure: 0.4
- Insulin: 0.26

## Visualization Insights
- Biomarker Correlation Heatmap: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Risk Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of healthcare_risk_261.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
