# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is FulfillmentTime. Task type is Regression. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 71/100 with about 5286 rows and 13 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- InventoryLevel: 0.37
- OrderVolume: 0.25
- TransportMode: 0.2

## Visualization Insights
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_199.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
