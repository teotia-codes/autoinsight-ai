# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to customer churn and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Churn. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 78/100 with about 28457 rows and 28 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Churn Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Retention Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Revenue per User: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- MonthlyCharges: 0.36
- ContractType: 0.3
- SupportCalls: 0.21

## Visualization Insights
- Tenure Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Revenue by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = CatBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of customer_churn_290.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
