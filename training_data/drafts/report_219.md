# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is StockoutRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 79/100 with about 21614 rows and 34 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- TransportMode: 0.48
- InventoryLevel: 0.47
- OrderVolume: 0.22

## Visualization Insights
- Lead Time Trend: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_219.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
