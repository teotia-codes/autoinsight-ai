# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Attrition. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 53/100 with about 2115 rows and 18 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed.

## KPI Highlights
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- MonthlyIncome: 0.43
- JobSatisfaction: 0.29
- YearsAtCompany: 0.29

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Attrition: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_137.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
