# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to retail sales and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Order Value. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = True. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 54/100 with about 10482 rows and 15 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Profit Margin: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Gross Profit: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Total Sales: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Region: 0.41
- Shipping Cost: 0.36
- Category: 0.34

## Visualization Insights
- Regional Sales Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Monthly Sales Trend: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Regressor, LightGBM Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of retail_sales_289.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
