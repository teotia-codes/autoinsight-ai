# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Default. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 78/100 with about 18749 rows and 12 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- LatePayments: 0.47
- DebtToIncome: 0.35
- CreditUtilization: 0.22

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Default: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Default Rate by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_255.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
