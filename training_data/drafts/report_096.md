# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is StockoutRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 89/100 with about 48822 rows and 33 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed.

## KPI Highlights
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- InventoryLevel: 0.43
- OrderVolume: 0.38
- SupplierRegion: 0.33

## Visualization Insights
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
2. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_096.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
