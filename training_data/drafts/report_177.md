# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is DeliveryDelay. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Medium. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 52/100 with about 24474 rows and 20 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- OrderVolume: 0.33
- SupplierRegion: 0.25
- LeadTime: 0.2

## Visualization Insights
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Lead Time Trend: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_177.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
