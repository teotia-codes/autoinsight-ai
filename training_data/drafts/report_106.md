# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to customer churn and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Churn. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 93/100 with about 43896 rows and 29 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed.

## KPI Highlights
- Retention Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Churn Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Revenue per User: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- SupportCalls: 0.46
- Usage: 0.39
- ContractType: 0.33

## Visualization Insights
- Revenue by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Churn by Contract Type: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of customer_churn_106.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
