# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is DeliveryDelay. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 62/100 with about 16341 rows and 16 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- LeadTime: 0.39
- OrderVolume: 0.24
- InventoryLevel: 0.18

## Visualization Insights
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_191.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
