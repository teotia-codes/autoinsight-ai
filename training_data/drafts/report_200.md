# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is FulfillmentTime. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Medium. Ambiguous = True. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 73/100 with about 16057 rows and 10 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- LeadTime: 0.47
- InventoryLevel: 0.47
- TransportMode: 0.19

## Visualization Insights
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_200.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
