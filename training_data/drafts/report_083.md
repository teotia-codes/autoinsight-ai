# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to customer churn and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is RetentionRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 55/100 with about 45442 rows and 32 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Churn Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Revenue per User: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Retention Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- MonthlyCharges: 0.45
- Tenure: 0.25
- ContractType: 0.25

## Visualization Insights
- Revenue by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Tenure Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of customer_churn_083.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
