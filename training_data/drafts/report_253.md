# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Attrition. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 93/100 with about 22932 rows and 33 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- YearsAtCompany: 0.34
- MonthlyIncome: 0.27
- JobSatisfaction: 0.2

## Visualization Insights
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Income vs Attrition: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_253.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
