# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Attrition. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Medium. Ambiguous = True. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 69/100 with about 22375 rows and 24 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- JobRole: 0.45
- JobSatisfaction: 0.43
- YearsAtCompany: 0.41

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Attrition: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_227.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
