# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Attrition. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = True. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 73/100 with about 23499 rows and 22 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- JobSatisfaction: 0.38
- JobRole: 0.29
- YearsAtCompany: 0.22

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Attrition: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_082.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
