# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to healthcare risk and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is HeartDiseaseRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = True. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 61/100 with about 38334 rows and 16 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Biomarker Score: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Positive Class Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Risk Prevalence: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- BMI: 0.42
- Insulin: 0.42
- Glucose: 0.35

## Visualization Insights
- Biomarker Correlation Heatmap: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Age vs Risk: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
3. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of healthcare_risk_114.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
