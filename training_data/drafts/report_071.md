# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is PerformanceScore. Task type is Regression. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 86/100 with about 24490 rows and 24 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- MonthlyIncome: 0.48
- Overtime: 0.47
- JobRole: 0.38

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Attrition: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_071.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
