# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Default. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = True. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 94/100 with about 42156 rows and 31 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- DebtToIncome: 0.46
- LoanAmount: 0.44
- Income: 0.32

## Visualization Insights
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Default Rate by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = LightGBM Classifier, XGBoost Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_197.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
