# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is FulfillmentTime. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 49/100 with about 43335 rows and 23 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- LeadTime: 0.32
- OrderVolume: 0.29
- InventoryLevel: 0.19

## Visualization Insights
- Lead Time Trend: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_264.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
