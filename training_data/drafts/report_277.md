# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is CreditScoreBand. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = True. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 85/100 with about 2032 rows and 32 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Income: 0.25
- LoanAmount: 0.22
- DebtToIncome: 0.22

## Visualization Insights
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Default Rate by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_277.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
