# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to healthcare risk and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is ReadmissionRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 94/100 with about 14286 rows and 16 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Risk Prevalence: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Positive Class Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Biomarker Score: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- BMI: 0.4
- Insulin: 0.38
- Age: 0.3

## Visualization Insights
- Biomarker Correlation Heatmap: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Risk Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of healthcare_risk_109.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
