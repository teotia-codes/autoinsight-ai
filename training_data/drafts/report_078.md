# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is CreditScoreBand. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 51/100 with about 3438 rows and 9 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Income: 0.48
- CreditUtilization: 0.35
- LoanAmount: 0.29

## Visualization Insights
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Income vs Default: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = LightGBM Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_078.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
