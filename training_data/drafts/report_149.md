# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Attrition. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = True. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 95/100 with about 48325 rows and 33 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- YearsAtCompany: 0.29
- MonthlyIncome: 0.27
- JobRole: 0.23

## Visualization Insights
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Income vs Attrition: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_149.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
