# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is FulfillmentTime. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = True. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 70/100 with about 39307 rows and 17 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- InventoryLevel: 0.26
- OrderVolume: 0.26
- SupplierRegion: 0.18

## Visualization Insights
- Lead Time Trend: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_041.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
