# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is CreditScoreBand. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. Multiple plausible targets may exist, so manual confirmation is recommended before production modeling.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 59/100 with about 30127 rows and 20 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- DebtToIncome: 0.43
- LoanAmount: 0.37
- Income: 0.3

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Default: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Classifier, LightGBM Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_209.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
