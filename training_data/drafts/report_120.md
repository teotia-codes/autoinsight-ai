# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to hr attrition and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is PerformanceScore. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Medium. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 88/100 with about 20168 rows and 28 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Correlation patterns suggest that a small subset of operational variables explains a meaningful share of target variation.

## KPI Highlights
- Performance Distribution: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Attrition Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Tenure: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Overtime: 0.4
- YearsAtCompany: 0.36
- JobRole: 0.27

## Visualization Insights
- Attrition by Department: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Tenure Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Validate the target variable against the intended analytical objective before production use.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of hr_attrition_120.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
