# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Default. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 87/100 with about 12554 rows and 31 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed.

## KPI Highlights
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Income: 0.45
- CreditUtilization: 0.41
- LoanAmount: 0.3

## Visualization Insights
- Default Rate by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
2. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_015.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
