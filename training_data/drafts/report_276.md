# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to customer churn and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is RetentionRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Medium. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 87/100 with about 1938 rows and 23 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Minor missing values in non-critical columns.
Recommendations: Proceed with light preprocessing, Validate feature types before training.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Outlier concentration in numeric fields may affect KPI interpretation and model stability if not addressed.

## KPI Highlights
- Retention Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Churn Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Revenue per User: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- MonthlyCharges: 0.42
- Usage: 0.39
- Tenure: 0.35

## Visualization Insights
- Tenure Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Churn by Contract Type: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of customer_churn_276.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
