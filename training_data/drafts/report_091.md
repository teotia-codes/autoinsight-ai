# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to customer churn and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Churn. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 48/100 with about 16157 rows and 25 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Segment-level differences indicate that performance is not uniform across categories, regions, or customer groups.

## KPI Highlights
- Retention Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Churn Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Revenue per User: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- MonthlyCharges: 0.36
- Usage: 0.21
- Tenure: 0.19

## Visualization Insights
- Revenue by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Churn by Contract Type: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = CatBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
2. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.
3. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of customer_churn_091.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
