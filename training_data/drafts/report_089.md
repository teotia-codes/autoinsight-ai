# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is CreditScoreBand. Task type is Classification. Confidence is High. Ambiguous = True. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 49/100 with about 42842 rows and 31 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- LatePayments: 0.48
- DebtToIncome: 0.46
- LoanAmount: 0.2

## Visualization Insights
- Income vs Default: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = False.
Potential leakage = None obvious.
Preprocessing recommendations = Standardize numeric variables, Validate categorical encoding.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, LightGBM Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Outliers may bias statistical summaries and tree-based importance signals if not reviewed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
2. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.
3. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_089.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
