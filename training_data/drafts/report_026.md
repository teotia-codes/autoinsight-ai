# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to customer churn and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is RetentionRisk. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 58/100 with about 36069 rows and 32 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Average Revenue per User: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Churn Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Retention Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Tenure: 0.47
- SupportCalls: 0.37
- MonthlyCharges: 0.21

## Visualization Insights
- Churn by Contract Type: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Tenure Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Requires Preprocessing. ML ready = False. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = High missingness and imbalance risk, Potential identifier leakage.
Preprocessing recommendations = Impute missing values, Remove identifiers, Resample target classes, Review target validity.
Suggested baseline models = Random Forest Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Class imbalance may reduce minority-class recall unless reweighting or resampling is applied.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Inspect outliers before deciding between clipping, winsorization, or exclusion.
2. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
3. Benchmark at least two baseline models before selecting a production candidate.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of customer_churn_026.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
