# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to supply chain and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is DeliveryDelay. Task type is Regression. Confidence is Medium. Ambiguous = False. The selected target is plausible but should be validated against stakeholder intent.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 69/100 with about 27613 rows and 29 columns.
Critical issues: None major.
Moderate issues: Missing values in selected columns, Potential outliers in numeric features.
Recommendations: Impute missing values, Review outliers before modeling.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- On-Time Delivery Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Fulfillment Time: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Stockout Frequency: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- TransportMode: 0.48
- InventoryLevel: 0.41
- SupplierRegion: 0.23

## Visualization Insights
- Stockout by Warehouse: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Delay by Supplier: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Gradient Boosting Regressor, XGBoost Regressor.

## Risks / Cautions
Identifier-like columns may distort signal ranking if retained in the modeling set.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Review subgroup performance to ensure the model generalizes across segments.
2. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
3. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of supply_chain_105.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
