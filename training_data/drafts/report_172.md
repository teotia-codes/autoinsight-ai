# Final Report

## Executive Summary
This dataset appears related to financial credit and seems usable for exploratory and predictive analysis. Some preprocessing is probably needed before production modeling.

## Target Validation
The likely target is Default. Task type is Classification. Confidence is Moderate. Ambiguous = False. The target selection appears aligned with the likely business objective.

## Key Data Quality Findings
Quality score is around 57/100 with about 1129 rows and 26 columns.
Critical issues: Identifier-like columns detected, Potential leakage risk in derived fields.
Moderate issues: High missingness in important fields, Potential outliers in key variables.
Recommendations: Perform substantial cleaning, Drop leakage-prone columns, Validate target carefully.

## Key Statistical / Analytical Findings
Skewness in important measures suggests that robust preprocessing could improve downstream modeling reliability.

## KPI Highlights
- Delinquency Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Average Credit Utilization: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior
- Default Rate: should be reviewed for trend and segment behavior

## Signal Ranking Highlights
Top signals look like:
- Income: 0.47
- DebtToIncome: 0.45
- LatePayments: 0.44

## Visualization Insights
- Utilization Distribution: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection
- Default Rate by Segment: useful for finding patterns but needs more inspection

## ML Readiness Assessment
Readiness is Conditionally Ready. ML ready = True. Class imbalance flag = True.
Potential leakage = Potential target leakage in engineered columns.
Preprocessing recommendations = Drop leakage-prone columns, Handle class imbalance, Review missing value strategy.
Suggested baseline models = Logistic Regression, LightGBM Classifier.

## Risks / Cautions
Potential leakage from post-outcome or engineered columns could inflate model performance if not removed.

## Actionable Recommendations
1. Impute missing values using domain-aware methods instead of blanket defaults.
2. Remove identifier-like columns and review high-cardinality fields before model training.
3. Confirm that engineered features do not leak post-outcome information.

## Conclusion
This report gives an initial analysis of credit_risk_172.csv and suggests the dataset may be useful after preprocessing, validation, and baseline benchmarking.
